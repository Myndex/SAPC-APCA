  <p>Myndex and Inclusive Reading Technologies are the only authoritative reference for APCA and related contrast guidelines.</p>
  <p>If you came here via the link from the xi repository, please be aware that repository is not authorized, and includes a substantial amount of misleading, incorrect, and or simply bizarre material that has little relationship to the reality of human perception of contrast.</p>
  <p>We were concerned regarding the potential confusion and furtherance of misunderstandings in a field that's already difficult to grasp, we analyzed and provided a corrected version, as well as rebuttals, to that very poorly conceived collection.</p>
