**This site's visually-readable primary content is designed to meet or exceed the conformance level of: _`<insert bronze/silver/gold>`_ as defined in version: _`<insert APCAversion>`_ of the beta APCA Readability Design Guidelines (RDG), which provide improved visual readability, enhancing the _actual_ accessibility for users of this website.

> ## APCA Accessibility Statement v0.2.0 (B) â€¢â€¢ alternate&nbsp;method, replacing WCAG&nbsp;2
>> *This, more complete statement, is aimed at sites that wish to more thoroughly promote readability and enhance actual accessibility, and for sites that >> may have some concerns or ambiguities regarding the replacement of WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast criteria.*
>>> _START_ &nbsp; &darr; &nbsp; (Supplant WCAG 2)


#### This website is using the [APCA](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/WhyAPCA)â„¢ readability guidelines for determining visual contrast of text and non-text elements.

Recent research, and advances in colorimetry, readability, and vision science, have shown that established math and methods for determining visual contrast, including those defined in WCAG&nbsp;2 (1.4.3), do not accurately model the human vision system's perception of text on self-illuminated displays, nor do the older guidelines indicate the actual _readability_.

The APCA maths, methods, and guidelines were developed to correct the deficiencies of the existing WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast criteria. APCA provides a substantial improvement in overall accessibility for visual readability, as well as providing  more flexible design choices. For instance APCA can **correctly calculate colors for dark mode** which WCAG&nbsp;2 cannot.

Additionally, **US Access Board 508 rules permit alternative methods**, other than WCAG&nbsp;2, so long as actual accessibility is maintained or enhanced. _(**REFERENCE:** Appendix A to Part 1194 â€“ Section 508 Chapter 1 Â§ E101.2 Equivalent Facilitation: **"The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability...is permitted.")**_

Therefore, incorporating APCA guidelines herein is a best practice for _actual_ accessibility and accommodating user needs for visual readability, in furtherance of the Americans with Disabilities Act. An implication however is that any _automated_ conformance testing, or measuring of contrast, on this site **must be conducted using a modern**, perceptually uniform, text-aware contrast method, such as [***APCA: Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm***](APCA)â„¢. The WCAG&nbsp;2.x (1.4.3) math, methods, and success criterion are **not relevant for this site.**

***REGARDING WCAG 3.0:*** **"APCAâ„¢ is still the candidate contrast method for WCAG&nbsp;3**, which has been pushed years into the future. But the needs of the accessibility and design communities cannot wait any longer, so the [***APCA***](APCA)â„¢ is _also_ being developed as an independent set of guidelines. Accessibility advocates, designers, and developers can access this technology now, as a public beta, with some minor caveats.

### Conformance level
**This site's primary visually-readable content is designed to meet or exceed the conformance level of: _`<insert bronze/silver/gold>`_ as defined in version: _`<insert APCAversion>`_ of the APCA Readability Design Guidelines (RDG), which provide improved visual readability, enhancing the actual accessibility for users of this website.**

***COMMENTS WELCOME:*** APCA is presently in public betaâ€”won't you join us in building a more readable future? Please let us know about any problems, questions, or concerns related to readability and functionality by contacting our accessibility manager at _`<insert Accessibility manager's contact info here>`_.

>> If you have a live tool or color system that uses APCA, or if you are putting together a library or framework that will have APCA code in it for others to integrate, then below is the accessibility statement that you would want to associate with those projects.

**The components, CSS properties, and design elements in this library were developed using the APCAâ„¢ readability guidelines for determining visual contrast of text and non-text elements.**

This library's visually readable color framework is intended to meet or exceed the conformance level of: <bronze/silver/gold> as defined in version: <APCAversion> of the APCA design guidelines, which provide improved visual readability, enhancing actual accessibility.

**This _`<contrast tool / color system / library / framework>`_ is using the [APCA](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/WhyAPCA)â„¢ algorithm and readability guidelines for determining visual contrast of text and non-text elements.**

Recent research and advances in colorimetry, readability, and vision science, have shown that established math & methods for determining visual contrast, including those defined in WCAG&nbsp;2 (1.4.3), do not accurately model the human vision system's perception of text on a self-illuminated display, nor do the older methods predict readability across the visual range.

The APCA math, method, and guidelines were developed to correct the deficiencies of the existing WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast criteria. APCA is a substantial advancement in visual readability, improving actual accessibility, as well as providing for more flexible design choices. For instance APCA can **correctly calculate colors for dark mode** which WCAG&nbsp;2 cannot.

Additionally, **US Access Board 508 rules** allow alternative methods, other than WCAG&nbsp;2, provided actual accessibility is maintained or enhanced. _(**REFERENCE:** Appendix A to Part 1194 â€“ Section 508 Chapter 1 Â§ E101.2 Equivalent Facilitation: **"The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability...is permitted.)**_

Of course, the compliance requirements for sites in different regions or jurisdictions should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, to certify the needs of their particular market sector. Nothing in this statement should be construed as legal advice.

***REGARDING WCAG 3.0:*** **"APCAâ„¢ is still the candidate contrast method for WCAG&nbsp;3**, and is currently in public beta. WCAG&nbsp;3 is still in very early development and subject to changes prior to adoption. Importantly, the current draft at W3C of WCAG&nbsp;3 does not yet contain the _current_ guidelines developed under APCA, as updating that draft is a very slow processâ€”WCAG&nbsp;3 is some years away at this point.

But the needs of the accessibility and design communities cannot wait any longer, so the [***APCA: Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm***](APCA)â„¢ is _also_ being developed as an independent set of guidelines. Accessibility advocates, designers, and developers can access this technology now as the public beta, with some minor caveats:

1. ***Use only the guidelines at the canonical Myndex repos.***
    - [**APCAcontrast.com**](https://apcacontrast.com) The official contrast calculator for APCA
    - [**APCA in a Nutshell**](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCA_in_a_Nutshell) Overview of using APCA basic use.
    - [**APCA Use Cases**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions/39) APCA Use Cases, Conformance, Research, and Glossary
    - [**Match a Font**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions/28#discussioncomment-1610289) How to match to a reference font for gold level compliance
    - [**In-line links**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions/65) draft guidance on how to handle in-line text link
2. ***Bridge PCA*** if you absolutely positively have to be backwards compatible to WCAG_2 ***by the numbers***, then you can [use Bridge PCA](https://www.myndex.com/BPCA/), and the Bridge PCA guidelines to give you better readability but also to match when WCAG_2 ncorrectly rejects.
    - Situations where you would be ***required*** to endure to the absolute letter of WCAG_2 contrast, appear to be fairly rare, as WCAG_2 is a voluntary guideline in most areas of the world.
    - Nevertheless it is important to recognize if you're in a region that does have such a requirement, and either use Bridge PCA, or use a WCAG_2 contrast checker alongside APCA to make sure that nothing slips by.
