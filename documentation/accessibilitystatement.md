## APCA Accessibility Statement
_Beta testers and sites using APCA may wish to include the following statement in their site's boilerplate:_

-----
### This website is beta testing the APCA guidelines for determining text and non-text contrast. It is well known that WCAG 2 contrast maths are not accurate regarding human perception, and automated testing using WCAG 2 math may incorrectly indicate errors in some color pairs on this site. The APCA guidelines are a substantial improvement in accessibility over WCAG 2 contrast criterions, and therefore compliant with the ADA and also 508 rules under the alternative methods section. Any automated testing done to determine conformance of this site needs to be conducted using a perceptually accurate method such as APCA.
