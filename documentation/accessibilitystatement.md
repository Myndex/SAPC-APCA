This site's visually-readable primary content is designed to meet or exceed the [***Bronze Simple***](https://readtech.org/ARC/tests/bronze-simple-mode/?tn=intro#summary) conformance level, as defined in version: (Public Beta Working Draft 2023), of the [APCA Readability Criteria (ARC)](https://readtech.org/ARC/), which provides improved visual readability, enhancing actual accessibility and visual readability for users of this website. If you have questions, concerns, or problems, please contact the accessibility manager or webmaster of this site. The APCA Readability Criteria is designed to substantially exceed earlier guidelines in terms of actual accessibility.

>> *This, more complete statement, is aimed at sites that wish to more thoroughly promote readability and enhance actual accessibility, and for sites that >> may have some concerns or ambiguities regarding the replacement of WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast criteria.*
>>> STATEMENT C _START_ &nbsp; &darr; &nbsp; (Supplant WCAG&nbsp;2)


#### This website is using the [APCA](git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCAeasyIntro)â„¢ readability guidelines for determining visual contrast of text and non-text elements.

Recent research, and advances in colorimetry, readability, and vision science, have shown that some established math and methods for determining visual contrast, including those defined in WCAG&nbsp;2 SC 1.4.3 and 1.4.11, do not accurately model the human vision system's perception of text and graphics on self-illuminated displays, nor do the older guidelines indicate the actual _readability_.

The APCA maths, methods, and guidelines were developed to correct the deficiencies of the existing WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast criteria.  The APCA Readability Criteria is designed to substantially exceed SC 1.4.3 and SC 1.4.11 of the WCAG 2.1 guidelines in terms of actual accessibility, as well as providing  more flexible design choices. For instance APCA can **correctly calculate colors for dark mode** which WCAG&nbsp;2 cannot.

Additionally, **US Access Board 508 rules permit alternative methods** other than WCAG&nbsp;2, as do many other rules or regulations, with the aim to provide for enhanced actual accessibility. _(**REFERENCE:** Appendix A to Part 1194 â€“ Section 508 Chapter 1 Â§ E101.2 Equivalent Facilitation: **"The use of an alternative design or technology that results in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability...is permitted.")**_

Therefore, incorporating APCA guidelines herein is a best practice for _actual_ accessibility and accommodating user needs for visual readability, in furtherance of the **_Americans with Disabilities Act_** (ADA). An implication however is that any _automated_ conformance testing or measuring of contrast, conducted on this site ***must be conducted using a modern***, perceptually uniform, text-aware contrast method, such as [***APCA: Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm***](APCA)â„¢. The WCAG&nbsp;2.x (1.4.3) math, methods, and success criterion are **not relevant for this site, and are obsolete as far as this site is concerned.**

***REGARDING WCAG&nbsp;3.0:*** **"APCAâ„¢ is still the candidate contrast method for WCAG&nbsp;3**, which has been pushed several years into the future. But the needs of the accessibility and design communities are pressing today, so the [***APCA***](APCA)â„¢ is _also_ being developed with an independent set of guidelines. Accessibility advocates, designers, and developers can access this technology now, as a public beta.

### Conformance level
**This site's visually-readable primary content is designed to meet or exceed the [***Bronze Simple***](https://readtech.org/ARC/tests/bronze-simple-mode/?tn=intro#summary) conformance level, as defined in version: (Public Beta Working Draft 2023), of the [APCA Readability Criteria (ARC)](https://readtech.org/ARC/), which provides improved visual readability, enhancing actual accessibility and visual readability for users of this website.**

***COMMENTS WELCOME:*** APCA is presently in public betaâ€”won't you join us in building a more readable future? If you have questions, concerns, or problems, please contact the accessibility manager or webmaster of this site. The APCA Readability Criteria is designed to substantially exceed SC 1.4.3 and SC 1.4.11 of the WCAG 2.1 guidelines in terms of actual accessibility.

>>> STATEMENT E _START_ &nbsp; &darr; &nbsp; (tools or libraries)

**This _`<contrast tool / color system / library / framework>`_ is using the [APCA](git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCAeasyIntro)â„¢ algorithm and readability guidelines for determining visual contrast of text and non-text elements.**

Recent research, and advances in colorimetry, readability, and vision science, have shown that some established math and methods for determining visual contrast, including those defined in WCAG&nbsp;2 SC 1.4.3 and 1.4.11, do not accurately model the human vision system's perception of text and graphics on self-illuminated displays, nor do the older guidelines indicate the actual _readability_.

The WCAG&nbsp;2.x (1.4.3) math, methods, and success criterion are **not relevant for this site, and are obsolete as far as this site is concerned.**

Of course, the compliance requirements for sites in different regions or jurisdictions should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, to certify the needs of their particular market sector. Nothing in this statement should be construed as legal advice.

***REGARDING WCAG&nbsp;3.0:*** **"APCAâ„¢ is still the candidate contrast method for WCAG&nbsp;3**, which has been pushed several years into the future. But the needs of the accessibility and design communities are pressing today, so the [***APCA***](APCA)â„¢ is _also_ being developed with an independent set of guidelines. Accessibility advocates, designers, and developers can access this technology now as the public beta, with some minor caveats:

1. ***Use only the guidelines at the canonical Myndex repos.***
    - [**The APCA Readability Criterion**](https://readtech.org/ARC/) APCA guidelines at ReadTech.org
    - [**APCAcontrast.com**](https://apcacontrast.com) The official contrast calculator for APCA
    - [**APCA Use Cases**](https://readtech.org/ARC/tests/visual-readability-contrast/?tn=conform#use-cases-text) APCA Use Cases, Conformance, Research, and Glossary
    - [**Match a Font**](https://readtech.org/ARC/tests/visual-readability-contrast/?tn=tests#conditional) How to match to a reference font for gold level compliance
    - [**In-line links**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions/65) draft work in progress guidance on how to handle in-line text link
2. ***Bridge PCA*** if you absolutely positively have to be backwards compatible to WCAG&nbsp;2 ***by the numbers***, then you can [use Bridge PCA](https://bridgepca.com), and the Bridge PCA guidelines to give you better readability but also to match when WCAG&nbsp;2 incorrectly rejects.
    - Situations where you would be ***required*** to ensure to the absolute letter of WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs appear to be fairly rare, as WCAG&nbsp;2 is a voluntary guideline in most areas of the world.
    - Nevertheless it is important to recognize if you're in a region that does have such a requirement, Bridge PCA is backwards compatible to WCAG&nbsp;2.
