# APC<span class="flipH">A</span> Accessibility Statement
_At their option, beta testers, early adopters, and sites using APCA to determine text and non-text contrast may wish to include the following statement in their site's boilerplate:_

## APCA Accessibility Statement v0.1.9
**This website is beta testing the APCA guidelines for determining text and non-text contrast. It is well known that WCAG 2 contrast maths and methods are not accurate regarding human perception of text, as a result automated testing using WCAG 2 maths may incorrectly indicate errors in some color pairs on this site. The APCA guidelines are a substantial improvement in accessibility over WCAG 2 contrast criterions, and therefore compliant with the ADA. Compliance with US Access Board 508 rules is per the alternative methods section. Compliance in other jurisdictions subject to evaluation. Any automated testing done to determine conformance of this site must be conducted using a perceptually accurate method of predicting text contrast, such as APCA. WCAG 2.x math, methods, and success criterion are notwithstanding.**

### This Site is Tested With APCA-W3 Version: &lt; _insert valid guidelines version here_ &gt;
