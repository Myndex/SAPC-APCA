### Got Questions? We Got Answers!
- [**_Open a discussion today!_**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions)
## Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm in a nutshell
APCA was developed independently as a part of the future WCAG&nbsp;3 standards, with the guidance and oversight of members of the W3 AGWG, Members of the US Access Board, and members of the accessibility community at large. All participants, beta testers, early adopters, are deeply thanked for their comments and contributions to the development of the APCA. Readability is for all!

- APCA uses modern vision science and is perceptually uniform.
- Studies demonstrate that APCA for WCAG&nbsp;3 is superior to WCAG&nbsp;2.x contrast methods.
- APCA can be used today as an independent standard to provide excellent guidance for contrasts for readability and understandability of web content.
    - however, WCAG&nbsp;3 is not an official standard yet, and it is useful to note that APCA it is _not_ backwards compatible with WCAG&nbsp;2.x.
    - This is mainly an issue if you have a contrasctual obligation or law to follow that demands WCAG 2 AA as a web standard.
    - Unfortunately WCAG 2 is substantially incorrect in certain areas of perception due to its basis on older standards and technologies. It is due to this that APCA was developed as the replacement for use in WCAG&nbsp;3, as a result complete backwards compatibility is not possible.
- The discussion tab is open here if you have questions or comments.
- This repo includes the basic APCA code, which returns a perceptually uniform contrast value.
- This iteration has been stable since February, future iterations of course planned.
    - While it is still pre-release beta, the general functioning is demonstratively useful.
    - This version is set for sRGB, a next iteration will change the inputs to allow any additive colorspace.
 - You _CAN_ use APCA simply to evaluate a perceived contrast (such as Lc&nbsp;75). But ALSO:
     - There are a variety of lookup tables that can be used to relate a contrast to a font size and weight.
     - Rounding the contrast to an integer is allowed, and interpolation can be used with a lookup table.
 - For simplicity, you can also use the "simple key levels" method (Lc&nbsp;45, 60, 75), which compares to WCAG 2 contrast (with one very light color) as:
     - Lc&nbsp;45 is "sort of" like 3:1
     - Lc&nbsp;60 is "sort of" like 4.5:1
     - Lc&nbsp;75 is "sort of" like 7:1
 - Unlike WCAG_2, APCA is polarity aware, so the BG and TEXT colors _must_ be sent to the correct inputs.

Please feel free to use the discussion area for any questions or comments.

## Why APCA

See [WHY APCA](WhyAPCA.md) for a brief explaination of the important differences of APCA for WCAG&nbsp;3 vs the old WCAG&nbsp;2.x/1.4.3 contrast guidelines.

### SAPC and APCA demo tools are live to play with.

**The basic simple version[ is the APCA page,](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/)** it includes the new scaling and the dynamic font matrix. The is the official WCAG3/Silver support version.

**The development version[ is the SAPC page,](https://www.myndex.com/SAPC/)** and this version includes the new RESEARCH MODE, which has some different tools you can activate to investigate the nature of a color or colors, including a simplified version of the middle contrast experiment - on the SAPC app it's called "split contrast mode".


## APCA is the _Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm_

APCA is a set of contrast assessment methods for predicting perceived contrast between sRGB colors on a computer monitor. It has been developed as an assessment method for W3 Silver/WCAG3 accessibility standards relating to content for computer displays and mobile devices.

### BASIC FEATURES
* Incorporates Spatial Frequency & Stimulus Size directly in predictions.
* Spectral weighting of luminance based on sRGB coefficients.
   - NEW: displayP3 added, AdobeRGB next.
* Separate weighting for normal and reverse polarity (dark text on light background vs light text on dark, aka dark mode.)
* Estimation and weighting of light adaptation for perceptual uniformity in a common "standard observer" model (see below).
* Spatial frequency considerations for font weight as part of calculations and further defined in a lookup table. (I.e. values Lc 60 and higher are weighted for fonts less than 24px, values less than Lc60 are weighted for large fonts and non text).
* Lookup table can be customised for different languages/character sets.

### THIS REPOSITORY, [and apca-w3](https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3) ARE THE ONLY CANONICAL SOURCES OF APPROVED APCA CODE.

If you are integrating code, please check here for official changes, or at apca-w3 for the W3 licensed version. This code is considered beta, and will change periodically. The repo for WCAG_3 compliance is [apca-w3.](https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3)

Files with **RESEARCH** or **DEV** in the name are part of ongoing research and should _NOT_ be used for developing conformance tools, and further are not licensed for use in distributed software, and should be considered experimental only.

**NOTICE: There are some obsolete code listings on some legacy working drafts of Silver aka WCAG 3. **These should not be used and are not compatible** with the current or future versions. If you developed code around these please let us know! We can help facilitate transitioning to the correct code and constants.**

[Visual Contrast Subgroup Wiki]: https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Visual_Contrast_of_Text_Subgroup

## IMPLEMENTATIONS
The base libraries are plain vanilla Javascript. Other languages may be in the "PORTS" folder. Many of the available inputs to the functions can remain at their defaults, though these extra inputs can be used in more specialized situations (such as creating content specifically for daylight/outdoors, or specifically for dark nights, etc.). 

A plain language walkthrough, LaTeX math, and related supporting information is below:

### APCA 0.1.9 4g constants and math

APCA is the **A**ccessible **P**erceptual **C**ontrast **A**lgorithm. The math below assumes the use of the web standard sRGB colorspace.
```javascript
 // 0.98G-4g full range version constants:
    
  Exponents =  { mainTRC: 2.4,       normBG: 0.56,       normTXT: 0.57,     revTXT: 0.62,     revBG: 0.65, };
  
  ColorSpace = { sRco: 0.2126729,    sGco: 0.7151522,    sBco: 0.0721750, };
    
  Clamps =     { blkThrs: 0.022,     blkClmp: 1.414,     loClip: 0.001,     deltaYmin: 0.0005, };
        
  Scalers =    { scaleBoW: 1.14,     loBoWthresh: 0.035991,  loBoWfactor: 27.7847239587675,  loBoWoffset: 0.027, 
                 scaleWoB: 1.14,     loWoBthresh: 0.035991,  loWoBfactor: 27.7847239587675,  loWoBoffset: 0.027, };	
```    

### The Plain English Steps Are:

- Convert the sRGB background and text colors to luminance: Y<sub>background</sub> and Y<sub>text</sub>
    - Convert from 8 bit integer to decimal 0.0-1.0
    - Linearize (remove gamma - shown in next step by applying a ^2.4 exponent
    - Apply sRGB coefficients and sum to **Y**
        - Y = (R/255)<sup>^2.4</sup> * 0.2126 + (G/255)<sup>^2.4</sup> * 0.7152 + (B/255)<sup>^2.4</sup> * 0.0722
    - We will call these Y<sub>text</sub> and Y<sub>background</sub>
- Determine if Y<sub>text</sub> or Y<sub>background</sub> is brighter (higher luminance, for contrast polarity)
    - Soft-clamp the colors but **only** if it is less than **0.022 Y**
        - **Soft Clamp:** subtract the color **Y** from 0.022 
        - Then apply a ^1.414 exponent to the result
        - Then add that result back to the Y of the darker color
            - clampedY = ( 0.022 - Y )<sup>^1.414</sup> + Y
- Apply power curve exponents to both colors for perceptual contrast
    - For dark text on a light background, use ^0.57 for Y<sub>text</sub> and ^0.56 for Y<sub>background</sub>
    - For light text on a dark background, use ^0.62 for Y<sub>text</sub> and ^0.65 for Y<sub>background</sub>
- Subtract Y<sub>text</sub> from Y<sub>background</sub>
    - **Always** subtract the Y<sub>text</sub> value from the Y<sub>background</sub> value ( BG - TXT )
        - For light text on a dark background, this will generate a negative number. 
        - This is intentional, so that negative values indicate light text on dark BGs, and positive values only indicate dark text on a light BG.  
- Multiply by the scale 1.14
    - THEN if the absolute value is less than threshold 0.1 return "contrast too low"
    - ELSE if positive, subtract the offset 0.027 and then multiply by 100 for Lc
    - ELSE if negative, add the offset 0.027 and then multiply by 100 for Lc
- Finally: compare the Lc value to the font lookup table for the language being used to determine the minimum font size and weight.

Glossary
--------

-   **Light** — visible light is energy in a narrow range of frequencies or wavelengths that can be detected or sensed by "photo sensitive cells" in the back of the eye. 
-   **Color** — color is not real, but a perception or interpretation by visual processing in the brain (in the brain's visual cortex) of stimulus from photosensitive cells in the eye. 
    -   **Hue** — refers to a particular color sensation, i.e. red, green, yellow, blue, etc. Hue does not exist in reality, it is solely the perception of the visual system responding to light of different frequencies.
    -   **Saturation** — the color intensity or purity, reduced by:
        -   **tint** (add white), 
        -   **shade** (add black), 
        -   **tone** (add grey), 
-   **Brightness** — a relative perception, see also perceptual lightness.
-   **Luminance (Y or L)** — a physical measure of visible light intensity. Luminance is mathematically linear as light is in the real world.
-   **Perceived Lightness `(L*)`** — the perception of physical light intensity. Perceptual lightness is mathematically nonlinear in regards to light in the real world, however, some perceptual models attempt to provide a mathematically linear version of perception which then presents light as non-linear. The symbol L* refers to `CIE L*a*b*`, and should not be confused with luminance L.
-   **Luma (*Y'* prime)** — is a gamma encoded, weighted signal used in some video encodings. It is not to be confused with linear luminance.
-   **Gamma** — or transfer curve (TRC) is a curve that is commonly applied to image data for storage or broadcast to reduce perceived noise and improve data utilization.
-   **Contrast** — is a perception of the difference between two objects/elements. There are many forms of contrast, and the different types of contrast interact with and are affected by each other as well as being affected by other aspects of vision.
    -   **Lightness contrast:** the difference in lightness and darkness between two items. This is a particularly important form of contrast for information such as text.
    -   **Spatial contrast:** in other words contrasts of size. Size contrasts directly affect the perception of lightness contrasts.
    -   **Hue contrast:** the perception of different light frequencies. Hue contrasts are three times weaker than lightness contrasts, and some people have problems perceiving some hues, so hue should never be a primary design contrast.
    -   **Positional contrasts:** the distance and/or orientation between objects is important in object recognition and identification.
    -   **Temporal contrasts:** contrasts of time, speed, and change. 
-   **Visual Acuity** — acuity refers to the ability of the eye's optics to focus light onto the photoreceptors on the back of the eye.
    -   Poor acuity is usually understood as blurry vision or an inability to focus.
-   **Spatial Frequency** — in a practical sense, this refers to the weight of a font, or the stroke width. A thinner font or narrower stroke width is a higher spatial frequency than a bolder or thicker stroke. Higher spatial frequencies require more luminance contrast to be visible than lower frequencies, such as a very bold large headline.

### Change Notices:
[ImportantChangeNotices.md]: ImportantChangeNotices.md

If you have been using any files from _this_ repository, be sure to read the file "[ImportantChangeNotices.md]" for critical updates that may affect results.

## SAPC/APCA CURRENT VERSION: 0.1.1 Constants: 4g

### January 27 2022
Font lookup table revised, now LUT ver  0.1.5 G constants. New the arrays in the data folder. More uniform response across multiple font families, and improved acuity weighting.

### January 18 2022
Font lookup table revised, still for 4G constants. Tighter conformance now. 

### January 2 2022
Font lookup table revised, still for 4G constants.

### December 1, 2021
All W3 licensed files moved to their own repository, AND     
**A new npm package has been released (of the W3 version) to ease integration!!**

### November 23, 2021
Adopting semantic versioning, adding a first 0. so the current version is **0.0.98G**

### November 17, 2021
Please see the new font lookup table (LUT3) (on this page, below)

### October 1, 2021
The base APCA with the 0.0.98G-4g constants is in the JS folder. 

### NEW CONSTANTS and NEW MATH:
(October 1, 2021) the 0.0.98G-4g math and constants have been in use now for months, and by all accounts are working well as expected. The revised code is available in the JS folder. The present version improves tracking of contrast perception. (Doubling or halving the L<sup>c</sup> value results in a perceived doubling or halving of contrast.) Also, smoother results for low contrasts and dark color pairs.

## _Accessibility Statement for Beta Sites_
_At their option, beta testers, early adopters, and sites using APCA to determine text and non-text contrast may wish to include the following statement in their site's boilerplate:_

-----
## APCA Accessibility Statement v0.1.9
**This website is beta testing the APCA guidelines for determining text and non-text contrast. It is well known that WCAG 2 contrast maths and methods are not accurate regarding human perception of text, as a result automated testing using WCAG 2 maths may incorrectly indicate errors in some color pairs on this site. The APCA guidelines are a substantial improvement in accessibility over WCAG 2 contrast criterions, and therefore compliant with the ADA. Compliance with US Access Board 508 rules is per the alternative methods section. Compliance in other jurisdictions subject to evaluation. Any automated testing done to determine conformance of this site must be conducted using a perceptually accurate method of predicting text contrast, such as APCA. WCAG 2.x math, methods, and success criterion are notwithstanding.**

### This Site is Tested With APCA-W3 Version: &lt; _insert valid guidelines version here_ &gt;
_End Accessibility Statement_

### _THE REVOLUTION WILL BE READABLE_<sup>™</sup>

 <img src="../images/APCAcolor4.png" width="640" alt="APCA The Revolution Will Be Readable">

-----
<sub>**Disclaimer:** _APCA is being evaluated as a replacement for WCAG 2 contrast math for future standards and guidelines, however, standards that will be incorporating APCA are still developmental. Because WCAG 2 contrast math does not accurately model human visual perception nor visual impairments, there will be discrepancies between WCAG 2 contrast math, and perceptually uniform models such as APCA. It is up to the end user to determine suitability of purpose for their region and conformance requirements._</sub>
