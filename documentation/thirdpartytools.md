# APC<span class="flipH">A</span> Tools & Apps
As APCA popularity increases, there is a rapidly growing list of tools. Please post a message in the [tools discussion]() to have your tool added to this list!

Take note that some of these tools are works in progress, and not all of them have been fully analyzed for accuracy or conformance to APCA standards. We will be starting qualification testing in the near future.


## _Third Party APCA Tools—Systems_
**Design System or Pallette Generation tools**


### [Tailwind](https://uicolors.app/create)
- It's a very cool tool, with a plugin for Figma, make sure to use the latest version as it is now updated to use the current APCA constants. This tool can show either WCAG2 or APCA.


### [Stark APCA Beta](https://www.getstark.co/blog/stark-APCA-beta)
- Yes, Stark has added APCA to their toolset as an option! It's available across the product line, and included in the free versions. Make sure to use the latest version which is updated to use the current APCA constants. This tool can show either WCAG2 or APCA.


### [Accessible Palette](https://AccessiblePalette.com)
- A very nice color selector by Eugene, see [his article as well](https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems) This shows both WCAG 2 and APCA.


### [Huetone](https://huetone.ardov.me/?palette=N4IgdghgtgpiBcICiAPaAHANjABABQmwBci4AaEACwFcYBnBAbVElgRAHEAnGATxAoBjAPaZhXBvEYgAxADMAbIsUDZMAIwaNqmQCMAJgYM6I606Z0AOAEw2bOhdceOdAFgDsHjzusBOP3466pbBwSAAugC%2BZCzQcIh4AJZgANaqImISTLJyudZy7jq5%2Bu4wAMxFuhCuggAMRcoQFRTy1tYQlgCsOrq%2BmgquVnVyrr46nZ217u06ZZNlYVEx4HHsAEow%2Bumi4pLS8rmuMOQ5cvq%2Bgify%2BhDuvmMtue7uCluP6mX6ruo90%2BX1LUsfRg1gBsk6ZVqcnUYJkcymtXqS1ibEQAE0YJgxAB3baZPanOSdGCWBqGXSkx5lCAFZpqSyWJoKHSCXQKdy1H4tXy6Vz6Tk6dwfSy1QYtVxtRGw9rqGFI6Io%2BKcHgwMB43bZeRQ3wwB6yQRyXW6XQ6XwQVnuSmyBQ8splK4S3yuKE%2BAqIwotdRE0Gw9SuSGIoKc3SB5ErVEgAAqMEI6qyUjU%2BRpch6ChjcitMhegl8%2BiutU6IcEb1ktQUljkEGZLSmCkEpR0iNcRJLMk51nKHtLst0oIiCvDSoAQphaHGCfJm0oUy1DPpcjPZBAIFVclY-Lo1%2BKpgbM%2BpBJ19II918-GLS-4FMTGwp1AoyiaouEKERhGB6NlJqo5aofaoA6ozpgpMYIKIGFAcmCIrykAA)
- Cool interface under development, lots of options. This tool can show either WCAG2 or APCA.

### [Ambient Color Generation Tool](https://ambient-rvx.web.app)
- This tool is designed to generate contrast ready color pallets built specifically for UI/UX design. Unlike other palette generation tools, Ambient generates the colors based on the primary color.


### [Atmos](https://atmos.style/contrast-checker)
- a contrast checker that is part of the Atmos design system.



### [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/#)
- The adaptive color theme function has an APCA option, however APCA has not yet been integrated into the color contrast tool or the dataviz tool. The Leonardo tool is pretty cool as it stands.

## _Third Party APCA Tools-Calculators_
**Calculators and Technology Demos**


### [Polypane Color Contrast](https://colorcontrast.app/#fg=%23107db5&bg=%23fff&level=aa&format=rgb&algo=APCA&filter=none)
- Killian's Contrast app, can show either WCAG2 or APCA.
    - _(Killian was the key designer behind the updated APCA demo tool at Myndex.)_

### [Cliam's Contrast](https://cliambrown.com/contrast/)
- A neat color checker that allows you to click to find a given contrast level.


### [contrast-suggester.com](https://contrast-suggester.com) 
Also a [GitHub repo too](https://github.com/Munawwar/apca-color-contrast)
- Suggests a contrasting color for a given color, font size, and font weight. 


### [Zebra for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/806578669827234193)
- Dan Hollick's Zebra contrast plug in for Figma.


### [Caravage for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1059851135811973410/Caravage)
- A Figma plugin to check the contrast accessibility of the selected text. It is still in beta, the developer @simonbrtrnd  mentions any feedback is appreciated.


### [RandomA11y APCA](https://randoma11y.com/apca?color=%23c91313)
- this is an interesting take on a tool that gives you the opposite color for the color that you choose.


### [contrast-checker Vercel app](https://contrast-checker.vercel.app/000000e6/d40511/ffcc00/ffcc004d/ffffff/0000000d/0000001a/76BD22/007C39)
- This WCAG 2 checker also shows APCA so you can see the relative differences.


### [Contrast Tools](https://contrast.tools)
- Nice clean interface, easy to use. This tool can show either WCAG2 or APCA.


### [Contrast Checker](https://contrast-checker.bellette.com.au/)
- A clever interface that demonstrates the key concepts as well.


### [APCA Flip Black/White](https://apca.digitallymarked.com)
Also, [the GitHib repo](https://github.com/digitallymarked/apca-calculator)

- This is a simple but informative interface, text is only black or white, and it's using APCA to determine when to flip between the two.


### [Japanese Experimental](https://develop.apca-calculator-ja.pages.dev)
Also, [the GitHib repo](https://github.com/shunito/apca-calculator-ja)

- This is a Japanese experimental version, it's part of the project for working on aligning Japanese writing systems.

----
### _BRIDGE PCS VARIANTS_

### [color-contrast.dev](https://www.color-contrast.dev)
- this is the first third-party implementation I've seen of Bridge PCA, the drop in replacement that's backwards compatible with WCAG2. Nice simple input interface that also gives you suggested colors to improve contrast.


### [Color Contrast iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/color-contrast/id1095478187?platform=iphone)
- This an iOS app to measure the contrast between two colours in a screenshot or mobile website. The APCA algorithm is available as an option, with the Bridge PCA being used to show the modified WCAG ratio.


-----
## _Browsers_

### [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-89/#apca)
- Available as an experimental feature, note that some versions maybe using obsolete constants and therefore may give incorrect results.

### [Microsoft Edge Dev Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2021/01/devtools#new-color-contrast-calculation---advanced-perceptual-contrast-algorithm-apca)
- Available as an experimental feature, note that some versions maybe using obsolete constants and therefore may give incorrect results.

- this is the design system plug-in for WordPress, I'm not quite sure how they're integrating a PCA but they do mention in the docs.


## _Works in Progress_
These are some works in progress, functionality was not complete at the last time I checked, and or may have math or implementation errors. If your tool is on this portion of the list, please feel free to reach out, I'm more than happy to assist.


### [ROKING-A11Y APCA Evaluator](https://hrobertking.github.io/roking-a11y/apca.htm)
- Has a visible look up table which changes based on the contrast. Has a pending pull request due to some errors in terms of the exponents and look up.


### [AdamSzakal APCA-contrast](https://acpa-contrast.netlify.app)
- The repo is spelled wrong (oops!): https://github.com/AdamSzakal/ACPA-contrast
Basically looks like a work in progress, does not show polarity in the results.


### [Visual Contrast Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1090308131937420683)
- Does not seem to work correctly??

## _Official Myndex Tools_

### [APCA W3 Tool](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/)
- The main canonical demonstration tool. Public beta. The is the candidate for the future WCAG 3 contrast method.
    - Note that this is not fully backwards compatible with WCAG 2 contrast math due to the non-perceptual nature of WCAG 2.
    - Legacy version available on [a backup link](https://myndex.github.io/SAPC-APCA/WEBTOOLS/APCA/) at this repo.
    - The dedicated domain name is [apcacontrast.com](https://apcacontrast.com)

### [Color Vision Deficiency (ColorBlind) Simulator](https://www.myndex.com/CVD/)
- The CVD sim, a clinically accurate simulation of various forms of color insensitive vision (aka color blind), most of the sims are derived from or based directly on the clinically accurate Brettel model. Allows you to process a screenshot of your page design and view several CVD types at once..

### [Bridge-PCA](https://www.myndex.com/BPCA/)
- Bridge PCA is a modified tool that is backwards compatible with WCAG 2 contrast, but using APCA technology.
    - In order to be backwards compatible, some design flexibility is given up, but accessibility is substantially improved over WCAG 2.
    -  The dedicated domain name is [bridgepca.com](https://bridgepca.com)

### [SAPC Development Site](https://www.myndex.com/SAPC/)
- The SAPC research demonstration tool, more detailed results than the APCA tool above, and a clickable "research mode" with technology demonstrators, interactive experiments, and much data about the colors in use.
- NOTE: This tool may not always match the main tool depending on current experimental protocols.
