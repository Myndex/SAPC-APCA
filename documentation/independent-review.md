## _Known Issues With WCAG&nbsp;2 Contrast_
### _Discussion with links to third party articles<br>written prior to the development of APCA_ 
The problems of 4.5:1 as a target for a guideline is that it not only impact those with impairments, but impacts standard vision as well. WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs affect 100% of sighted users. The inherent problems with the WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast math have been known for some time and [**widely criticized**](https://macwright.com/2019/03/30/color-contrast-is-a-problem.html). Including studies [**by others showing that color insensitive types**](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/) are not well served. 

The WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast specs often cause enough problems for designers [**that it is ignored**](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/) and today, some 86% of websites are failing WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast per an automated survey—though some of these failures are not due to poor actual accessibility, but due to the perceptual inaccuracies of WCAG\_2 contrast.

The unfortunate end result is a grave distrust of the WCAG&nbsp;2.x accessibility standards overall, despite the many other important aspects of those standards.

## _Prima Facia Evidence and Public Comment_
Outside of the peer reviews, third party reviews, and the extended 2.5 years of public beta test data collected thus far, you as a user can make your own judgements, using [the tools](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/thirdpartytools) and inspecting the results. 

For instance, look at the following examples of minimum compliance for content for WCAG 2 (left) and APCA (right). Which one would you rather defend in a court of law? Which one would you rather sites followed?

<p align="center">
<img width="692" alt="WCAG v2 vs APCA Dark Mode Compare, showing the minimums for each. The WCAG 2 example is clearly unreadably low contrast, as if WCAG 2 is meaningless for dark mode. APCA however is clearly readable." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/77463333eef8fcae190c2d9392dc4300d3ce7459/images/DarkModeComparev2_2022.png">  
</p>

### Public Comment and Discussion
Public comment and discussion is encouraged. The [**APCA discussion forum**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions) is alive and well, please join in the discussion, share and discuss your findings during the open public test period.
