## _Independent Peer Reviews of APCA and<br>Third Party Comparisons vs WCAG&nbsp;2_
There are several independent researchers evaluating APCA, and additional third party comparitive reviews that include demonstrations of the functional superiority to existing methods. The first few listed below are technical reviews by peers evaluating the APCA math and methods, including journal published peer reviewed papers. Some in comparison to WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast methods and guidelines. 

APCA has been developed in the open for open peer review and discussion, and the reviews listed below were performed independently, the majority were completed without consulting the APCA developers.

## Known Issues With WCAG&nbsp;2 Contrast
### _Discussion with links to third party articles<br>written prior to the development of APCA_ 
The problems of 4.5:1 as a target for a guideline is that it not only impact those with impairments, but impacts standard vision as well. WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast SCs affect 100% of sighted users. The inherent problems with the WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast math have been known for some time and [**widely critisized**](https://macwright.com/2019/03/30/color-contrast-is-a-problem.html). Including studies [**by others showing that color insensitive types**](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/) are not well served. 

The WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast specs often cause enough problems for designers [**that it is ignored**](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/) and today, some 86% of websites are failing WCAG&nbsp;2 contrast per an automated survey—though some of these failures are not due to poor actual accessibility, but due to the perceptual inaccuracies of WCAG\_2 contrast.

The unfortunate end result is a grave distrust of the WCAG&nbsp;2.x accessibility standards overall, despite the many other important aspects of those standards.

## Public Comment and Discussion
Public comment and discussion is encouraged. The [**APCA discussion forum**](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions) is alive and well, please join in the discussion.

## Prima Facia Evidence
Outside of the peer reviews, third party reviews, and the extended 2.5 years of public beta test data collected thus far, you as a user can make your own judgements, using [the tools](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/thirdpartytools) and inspecting the results. 

For instance, look at the following examples of minimum compliance for content for WCAG 2 (left) and APCA (right). Which one would you rather defend in a court of law? Which one would you rather sites followed?
