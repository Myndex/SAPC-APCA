### Other licensing information

All Files _in this Repository_ may have different license terms on a per-file basis. This is due to the ephemeral quality of early development. Because this contrast method is part of developing standards, it is important to keep invalid verions out of distribution. Files, code, or other assets related to SAPC, APCA, Perceptex, or Myndex Perception Research, that are not _currently_ in this repository are not available for license or use without a written agreement.

## WITHDRAWN ASSETS
ONLY files that are currently in this repository are available for use under these license terms.

As some code herein is early beta, and there is a clear interest to prevent obsolete verions from propogating, license for use is revoked when any such asset is removed from this repositiory. Prior to revocation, files will be placed in the OBSOLETE/PENDING_DELETE folder for a period to allow time for revision. Please replace any stale assets with the revised assets herein as soon as practical.

#### The current assets shall be in:
    /dist/    
    /src/
#### Non breaking earlier versions shall be placed in:
    /LEGACY/
#### Breaking and deprecated versions shall be placed in:
    /DEPRECATED/
#### Breaking, invalid, and revoked versions shall be placed in:
    /OBSOLETE/    
    /OBSOLETE/PENDING_DELETE/
    /IGNORE/

### Fixed Term Licensing
Due to the current developmental nature of this project, existing licenses shall expire december 31st 2022, however, at the discretio of Myndex Technologies, such licenses may be extended on an as needed basis. A permanent form of license shall be made available at the time of the first official release.
