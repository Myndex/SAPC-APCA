## NON COMMERCIAL VERSION DISCLAIMER AND RESTRICTIONS

_**DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF USE:**_       
**SAPC** and the **APCA** is an embodiment of certain supra-threshold contrast
prediction technologies and it is licensed on a
limited basis for web content only. **APCA** may be used in non-commercial software for 
predicting contrast for web content, and used for that
specific purpose without royalty.

Said license excludes other use cases
not related to web content. Prohibited uses include
medical, clinical evaluation, human safety related,
aerospace, transportation, military applications, 
and uses which are not specific to web-based content
presented on self-illuminated displays or devices.

_**RIGHT TO AUDIT CODE**_     
Any integration of APCA, SAPC, or SACAM which is in a commercial app or behind a paywall, free access must be provided to Myndex Research, or their assigns, on request, for the purpose of evaluating and verifying correct operations and implementation of the APCA/SAPC/SACAM functions.

_**NO ALTERATION; KEEP CURRENT**_     
Any **SAPC/APCA** files in this repository may be used or incorporated only in tools for web-based content or web related content in support of the WCAG accessibility guidelines, and such use must be without modification to the essential elements of the code or specific approved constants, except as required to port to a given language.

- Developers incorporating this code into their applications, widgets, or other tools, have a duty to ensure that the most recent version of this code is used in their current or any future release. 

- Breaking change exception:
    - developers do not need to incorporate a future version of **APCA** that has breaking changes if their release is only a minor or patch version per semantic versioning.
    - developers with minor or patch revisions are still obligated to use the latest non-breaking branch of **APCA**.
    - developers with a major revision per semantic versioning are obligated to use the most recent stable **APCA**.

_**USE OF THE APCA LOGO AND TRADEMARK**_     
Use of the APCA or "Powered by APCA" logos or trademarks are prohibited without written consent from Myndex™ Technologies, Myndex™ Research, Andrew Somers, and/or the authorized agents or assigns.
- Developers wishing to use the APCA or "Powered by APCA" logos or trademarks must submit their application or tools for qualification to be granted a limited license to use the APCA or "Powered by APCA" logos or trademarks.
- Formal details on the APCA and "Powered by APCA" qualification process are pending. In the interim, make a qualification request in the discussion tab of this repo.

**_DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF USE:_**

APCA is an embodiment of certain supra-threshold contrast
prediction technologies. Versions marked as licensed to 
the W3 are strictly limited to web content use only for 
supporting certain accessibility guidelines.

APCA code listed here is provided as is, with no 
warrantees expressed nor implied. We accept no 
liability for any use or misuse of the code. 
Suitability of  purpose resides with the 
integrator or end user.

Commercial use is prohibited without a written 
and signed commercial license agreement.

Non-commercial use is permitted only for 
predicting contrast for web content, no 
other use case is authorized.

License excludes other use cases not related to web 
content. Prohibited uses include and are not limited 
to medical, clinical evaluation, human safety related, 
aerospace, transportation, military applications, and 
uses which are not specific to web-based content 
presented on self-illuminated displays or devices.

### Other licensing information

All Files _in this Repository_ may have different license terms on a per-file basis. This is due to the ephemeral quality of early development. Because this contrast method is part of developing standards, it is important to keep invalid versions out of distribution. Files, code, or other assets related to SAPC, APCA, Perceptex, or Myndex Perception Research, that are not _currently_ in this repository are not available for license or use without a written agreement.

## WITHDRAWN ASSETS
ONLY files that are currently in this repository are available for use under these license terms.

As some code herein is early beta, and there is a clear interest to prevent obsolete versions from propagating, license for use is revoked when any such asset is removed from this repository. Prior to revocation, files will be placed in the OBSOLETE/PENDING_DELETE folder for a period to allow time for revision. Please replace any stale assets with the revised assets herein as soon as practical.

#### The current assets shall be in:
    /dist/    
    /src/
#### Non breaking earlier versions shall be placed in:
    /LEGACY/
#### Breaking and deprecated versions shall be placed in:
    /DEPRECATED/
#### Breaking, invalid, and revoked versions shall be placed in:
    /OBSOLETE/    
    /OBSOLETE/PENDING_DELETE/
    /IGNORE/

### Fixed Term Licensing
Due to the current developmental nature of this project, existing licenses shall expire December 31st 2022, however, at the discretion of Myndex Technologies, such licenses may be extended on an as needed basis. A permanent form of license shall be made available at the time of the first official release.


<sub>**Disclaimer:** _APCA is being evaluated for future standards and guidelines, however, standards that will be incorporating APCA are still developmental. Because WCAG 2 contrast math does not accurately model human visual perception nor visual impairments, there will be discrepancies between WCAG 2 contrast math, and perceptually uniform models such as APCA. It is up to the end user to determine suitability of purpose for their region and conformance requirements._</sub>
